                <p>Dexter's Disciples  was founded by brothers, Glenn & Gerry Rome. Figuring out a band name totally sucked. It seemed like every name I came up with was already taken. I asked my wife, Christina, to help me out but everything she came up with was taken too. The names that weren't didn't seem to fit our style.
                </p>
                <p>One night I was sitting on my bed thinking of a good name to call our band, when the show Dexter popped into my head, and I thought, "Dexter's Disciples".  After telling my wife about it, she laughed and said, "No need to look anymore. That's it!". I then emailed Gerry with the name to see what he thought and his response was....
                "LMAO! Love it!".
                </p>
                <p>***The band name comes from the Showtime hit series  Dexter.  After telling me about the show, Gerry had loaned me some blu-rays to watch and I was hooked.***

                <p>After checking to make sure no other band had claimed the name, I went to work right away getting our spot for email, Facebook, and a website. All was going well until I started in on our Facebook page. There it was! An app/game called, you guessed it, 'Dexter's Disciples'. For <br />a moment, I was pissed because I thought I had been truly original. Then I thought, "Hey, we're the only band listed with that name so screw it!"</p>
